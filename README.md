# MemcachedVagrant
A Vagrant box that acts like a Memcached server

## Purpose
Don't really want Memcached running on my computer the entire time

## Requirements
You need to have VirtualBox and Vagrant installed. Everything else is inside the VM. 

## Installation
Standard for Vagrant. We just launch a VM using: ```vagrant up```, then ssh into the box: ```vagrant ssh```.

Any issue can probably be fixed with a quick ```vagrant provision```.
